# raylib-4coder-remedybg-microsoft-compiler-batch-file-tutorial

This tutorial is insanely specific but at the same time, I find it highly appealing to be able to use RemedyBG when working on a raylib project. RemedyBG only works with pdb files, and while I'm pretty sure you can also use clang to produce one (according to ziv.k), I might as well use the Microsoft compiler to do it since pdb is a file format made by Microsoft, and also because neither clang nor the Microsoft compiler are used by raylib by default.

To follow this tutorial, you must install the following applications:
4coder: https://4coder.itch.io/4coder
RemedyBG: https://remedybg.itch.io/remedybg
