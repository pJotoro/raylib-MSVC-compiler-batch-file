# raylib Microsoft compiler batch file tutorial

Why did I decide to do this? Why not just use MinGW like everyone else? The reason is simply that my favorite debugger is RemedyBG and that this debugger requires that you use a pdb file. You can also generate this file with clang according to ziv.k, but I wanted to use the Microsoft C/C++ compiler since pdb is made by Microsoft, and also because neither compiler is easier to get working with raylib to my knowledge.
